## Microsoft engage 2022 data analysis project

## Objective
 This projects aims at studying and analyzing various trends of the industry as well as market predictions.
 
 ## Insights
 This Analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook. Data is obtained as csv file. After Cleansing the datasheet predictions were made comparing aspects such as
 * Top car varient selling cars
 * Popular car types
 * Price range analysis in market
 * Car model vs price
 * Dominant Fuel type 

### Requirements 
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed, 
and then install the following libraries 
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) 
2. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
5. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### RESULTS
The following conclusions were obtained:
* Maruti Suzuki,Hyundai,Toyota,Tata and Mahindra are the top 5 companies with more car varaints.
* Most of the engine size is between the range of 624cc to 2000cc.
* SUVs are the most popular type of Cars, followed by Hatchbacks and Sedan.
* Large number of cars have the price range of 5-10 Lakh.
* The Sedan sells at the highest Ex-Showroomprice followed by Sedan,couple and Sports.
* Usage of Petrol and Diesel fuel types are in dominant numbers.
* As Displacement of car increases price also increases.
* correlation and pie charts were also obtained for better analysis



### Future scope
This is not the end. Further I aim to develop this appilication by
1. Adding Machine Learning algorithms to the code
2. full end application
